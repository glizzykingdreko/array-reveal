## Overview
The **ArrayReveal Web App** is built on the ArrayReveal Babel Plugin to provide a quick and user-friendly interface for deobfuscating JavaScript files using Array-Index Obfuscation.

This web app is perfect for:
- Developers who want a fast solution without the need to set up a local environment.
- Beginners who need to understand obfuscated scripts without diving into Babel configurations.

## Features
- **Paste and Reveal**: Copy-paste your obfuscated JavaScript code into the app and get clean, deobfuscated output.
- **No Setup Required**: The app works out of the box and is hosted online for easy access.

## How to Use
1. Open the ArrayReveal web app.
2. Paste your obfuscated JavaScript code into the input box.
3. Click the **Deobfuscate** button.
4. View or copy the deobfuscated code.

## Limitations
The plugin is designed for low-level obfuscations and assumes a single array-based obfuscation per script. Advanced scripts with multiple layers of obfuscation may require manual intervention or additional tooling.
